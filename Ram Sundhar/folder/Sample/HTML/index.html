<h6>In the present day, Albedo is arrogant, egotistical, ambitious, and bitter. He is unaccepting of Ben's right to wear the Omnitrix, thinking that Ben is just an unworthy human. He bears animosity towards Azmuth, even so much as claiming the credit for the creation of the Omnitrix for himself.</h6>
